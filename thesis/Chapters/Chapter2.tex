With the rapid increase in the development of products and benefits offering full-motion digital video, digital video coding is currently gaining importance and has a considerable monetary impact on computer, imaging and telecommunications technology. Throughout the early phases of technology, there have been many international video coding standards as engines behind the commercial success of digital video compression. In comparison to current existing standards, H264 has many new features that makes it more emphatic. The important features that distinguish H264 from other standards are good video quality at high and low bit rates and network friendliness. \cite{amer2005high}

It is proposed that H264 can deliver two times better performance than the previous MPEG-2 coding standard, both in terms of compression efficiency and picture eminence. Moreover, previous H.63 and MPEG-4 implement block-based motion estimation to reduce temporal redundancy between frames. But in H.264, block matching efficiency is improved by some innovative features such as variable block size motion estimation (VBS$\_$ME) and motion vector prediction \cite{li2003serial}. The computational complexity of this model is increased by the factor of four due to these features.
