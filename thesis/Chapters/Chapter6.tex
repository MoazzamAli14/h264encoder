\section{Future Directions}
Our project is a part of a long term project that aims to develop an open souce ISP. The idea is to develop a main RISC-V based processor, a video processor, ISP and integrate them on ChipYard to fabricate an IC. Our open source camera chip may gain significant traction and adoption as the demand for sustainable and secure camera solutions grows in the market.

With evolving security concerns, the emphasis on improving the security features of camera systems with increase and our projects data protection and security will surely meet these requirements.

As, this project is open source it has a potential for customization and flexibility, this will allow engineers to tailor this chip's functionality to their specific needs.

New emerging technologies such as Artificial intelligence, edge computing and Machine learning can enhance the capability of camera systems by enabling features such as advanced image recognition, intelligent decision making and real-time analytic.

This project, after gaining enough credibility, may attract a community of developers and contributors who can contribute to enhance the capabilities of this chip.
